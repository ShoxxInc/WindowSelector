Want the following logic:
- boot program, probably with graphical interface
- button load previous data from config file?
- button alternative 1 "select all game windows"
    - make list of all previously selected game windows
        - make user confirm sublist
        - option to repeat (too many games)
- button alternative 2 "search active processes for names"
- confirm final game list
- option: choose ordering for cycle-button
    - choose button for cycle for and back
- option: choose individual button for each window.
    - choose button/combination for each window.
- store in config file! (In case of crashes NOT for repeats, because of changing PIDs)
- run, with status window of log of current and previous selections
    - button to show key mapping
